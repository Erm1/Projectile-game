# Projectile-game

1. All the code is explained in the java code. To add few things about the game,
   the game continues unless the user stops it or unless the score becomes zero.
   At each round of the game, there will be a random height and distance generated
   by the Random class. And the Scanner prompts the player to input integer values 
   for Projection Angle and Projection speed which then uses it to make calculateions 
   for the height of the projection at a random distance generated by the random class.
   Each launch costs 1 point. A close clear gets 5 points (so +4 net). A far clear gets 
   +2 net. A near miss loses 1 point net and a far miss loses 3 points net. 
   The program also informs the user of their score after each launch and at the end of each round.
